                Up to this age, I have constantly been tasked with the question of "what makes time useful?" or "how can I make something great?" 
            These questions are the fuel I use everyday to progress myself into becoming somebody who will change the world, which is ultimately 
            what I hope to be when I am older. Every project I do, whether it is computer related or not, I do it to evolve and expand my 
            knowledge so I can eventually reach this goal. But what makes robotics and programming stand out from the rest, is that not only can I
            see myself changing the world using them, but I enjoy them now because they allow my creativity to flow in ways I would have never expected.</p>
